      <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (primarily referred to as D&D 5e) is a fantastic introduction to the world of table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs); it is accessible for newcomers while retaining enough depth to satisfy those that are unfamiliar with other TTRPG systems.  It achieves this by placing a heavy emphasis on gameplay systems that are easy to understand and keep track of, which allows players to focus on the role-playing aspect of the game.<br><br>However, with this accessibility, comes a lack of depth in 5e's gameplay systems.  Those who become enamored with the tactical combat of the game often find themselves wanting for more intricate mechanics after spending enough time with 5e.<br><br>Thus, I present Eliadras TTRPG: a system that expands upon the best concepts and ideas from D&D 5e by implementing additional depth to the systems in a way that feels like a natural progression from D&D 5e.</p><br>
      <h1>Concepts Overview</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Improves action economy by providing players additional action options, as well as increasing per turn action counts.</li>
          <li>Per turn action counts can be further boosted by players using the "heroism" mechanic on their turn, allowing the player to perform an additional action at a risk to their character's current condition.</li>
          <li>Sub-class identity improvements via the addition of more consistent sub-class features with each level.</li>
          <li>More character build options and customization through multiple system changes, such as: increased frequency of variant features, increased frequency of feats and ability stat increases, as well as allowing players to take both a feat and ability stat increases, as opposed to choosing one over the other.</li>
        </ul>
